The Sudoku Validator Program (SVP) shall validate a 9x9 completed puzzle for correctness 
The SVP shall accept as input an ASCII .txt file with the elements separated by commas and structured as a 9x9 table
The SVP shall specify via output to the user where the error occurred (e.g. column 5, row 3 â€“ preference would be 1-based answers)
Once the SVP detects an error, it must also specify what is the correct solution for that cell
The SVP shall provide user feedback to the GUI or CLI to help explain what is going on and the final answer
